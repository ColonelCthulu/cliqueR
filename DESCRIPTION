Description: A tool for finding maximal, maximum, and paracliques within graphs. The input should be an edge
        list file where the first line is the number of vertices followed by the number of edges (tab-separated)
        followed by each edge on a line (edges should be tab separated vertices). A format checker function verifies
        that the graph is valid and in the correct format.
